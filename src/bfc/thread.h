/**
  class Thread is a portable wrapper for an operating system thread. A thread
  is a thread of execution in a process. Ask Google if you don't know what that
  means.

  To use this class, derive from Thread and override the threadProc() method.
  Simply return from this method and the thread will end.

  Our Thread works on the kill-switch concept. You should write your thread
  code to continually check the getKillSwitch() method to determine if you
  should exit. When either getKillSwitch() returns TRUE or your processing is
  done, just return from the method and the thread will end.

  thread. If you do, the getKillSwitch function will check if this thread is
  still running, and return TRUE if it has died. Usually this other thread
  will be the main thread.
  Threads are created in a suspended state. To start them, call start().
