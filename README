To compile :

cd build
./make-wasabitest
./make-wconfig

Do NOT run ./configure directly on the command line, unless you provide it with the C and CXX flags that point to your wasabicfg.h

Overview : 

The source code is in the src/ subdirectory, the top directory is the base directory for make but it will not compile
out of the box, you need to visit the ./build directory and configure your wasabi library from there, or compile
a project that has a similar configuration as that which you want and steal the libwasabi.a from it (see build/make-*,
each project copies its libwasabi.a in the build directory after compilation).

--

wasabitest is a small testing application, that tries the various APIs.

wconfig is something i'm working on to take care of the dependencies between APIs and other packages, so that it'll
build automatically the configure scripts (or rather it'll build scripts that will run configure with the right
parameters). ultimately it could even generate the sdk, or something, but we'll see.
